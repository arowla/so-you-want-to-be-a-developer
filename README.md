List of books and resources to go from not-a-dev to Python web developer


## Learning Python (from most beginner to more advanced)

1. [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/) (easier)
2. [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Selenium-JavaScript/dp/1491958707/) (harder)

Also:
- [Data Wrangling with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1545157737&sr=8-2&keywords=data+wrangling+with+python

## Learning Data Modelling

Development is not just about learning language syntax. A huge part of it is learning to make abstract representations of things in the real world (and relationships between them). Therefore it's really helpful to learn about how data gets modelled in databases.

1. [Database Design for Mere Mortals](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Design-Mere-Mortals-Hands/dp/0321884493/)

## Learning Pattern Matching

Another part of programming is trying to make sense out of unstructured data coming in from the real world. An example of "unstructured data" could mean something as simple as the text of a book. "Regular Expressions" is the weird name for a pattern matching language that can be used across almost all programming languages, including Python. "Learning Regular Expressions" will help you learn to think about data in patterns and give you a toolkit for finding and matching those patterns 

1. [Mastering Regular Expressions](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124/)
